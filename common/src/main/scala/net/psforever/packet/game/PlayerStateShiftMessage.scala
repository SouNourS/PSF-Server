/**
  * Instructs an avatar to be stood, to look, and to move, in a certain way.<br>
  * <br>
  * The position defines a coordinate location in the avatar's current zone to which the avatar is immediately moved
  * This movement is instantaneous and has no associated animation.
  * If velocity is defined, the avatar is provided an "external force" that "pushes" the avatar in a given direction.
  * This external force is not accumulative.
  * Also, the external force is only applied once the avatar is set to the provided position.<br>
  * <br>
  * `viewYawLim` defines a "range of angles" that the avatar may look centered on the supplied angle.
  * The avatar must be facing within 60-degrees of that direction, subjectively his left or his right.
  * The avatar's view is immediately set to the closest 60-degree mark if it is outside of that range.
  * The absolute angular displacement of the avatar is considered before applying this corrective behavior.
  * After rotating any number of times:
  * stopping in a valid part of the range is acceptable;
  * stopping in an invalid part of the range will cause the avatar to align to the __earliest__ still-valid 60-degree mark.
  * For that reason, even if the avatar's final angle is closest to the "left mark," it may re-align to the "right mark."
  * This also resets the avatar's angular displacement.
  * @param pos the position to move the character to in the world environment
  * @param viewYawLim an angle with respect to the horizon towards which the avatar is looking (to some respect)
  * @param vel if defined, the velocity to apply to to the character at the given position
